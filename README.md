1. What are percentage of death from the total case per country and what country that has the highest percentage of death ?
2. For each continent Which country has the highest death percentage based on total cases ?

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is Covid deaths and Covid Vaccination. Covid death data contains the number of deaths of each country and continent as well as total death around the world. 
While covid vaccination contains the number of people who already vaccinated in each country. The data is from April 2020 until April 2021.
The covid data was taken from Alex the Analyst project SQL EDA on this link [Data Set](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/PortfolioProjects/blob/main/CovidDeaths.xlsx) or you can download the original data from its original website here [Original Data Set](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths).
For the first step of this post not all data in the columns will be used, the analysis may be broaden in the future using more data provided. 

## Technologies
SQLite is used to do the analysis, SQLite was chosen because it is light and easy to use for beginner.
